This project is for PIC16F877A. An LDR input should be connected to AN0 (pin 2). 
Depending on the light intensity in the room, the resistance of the LDR changes.
The LDR is connected one leg to ground and the other to AN0. Another resistance (10 Kohm) is connected between AN0 and VDD.
LEDs on PORTB and PORTD should be connected to light the room when the ambient is dark.
